       standard for representation of dates and times using the

       date-time production in Section 5.6 of RFC 3339.

       The date-and-time type is compatible with the dateTime XML
       schema type with the following notable exceptions:

       (a) The date-and-time type does not allow negative years.

       (b) The date-and-time time-offset -0
#1024
0:00 indicates an unknown
           time zone (see RFC 3339) while -00:00 and +00:00 and Z
           all represent the same time zone in dateTime.

       (c) The canonical format (see below) of data-and-time values
           differs from the canonical format used by the dateTime XML
           schema type, which requires all times to be in UTC using
           the time-offset 'Z'.

       This type is not equivalent to the DateAndTime textual
       convention of the SMIv2 since RFC 3339 uses a different
       separator between full-date and full-time and provides
       higher resolution of time-secfrac.

       The canonical format for date-and-time values with a known time
       zone uses a numeric time zone offset that is calculated using
       the device's configured known offset to UTC time.  A change of
       the device's offset to UTC time will cause date-and-time values
       to change accordingly.  Such changes might happen periodically
       in case a server follows automatically daylight

 saving time
       (DST) time zone offset changes.  The canonical format for
