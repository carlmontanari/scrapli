    # On some versions of VRP running on the AR160 & AR650 router series (and possibly
    # others), the router outputs the current OS version in the following format when
    # calling the command 'display current-configuration':

    # Since the version string is basically in the same format as the prompt in
    # configuration mode, scrapli only reads until it sees this very string, and then
    # stops reading since it assumes that a valid prompt has been found.
    #
    # The following pattern tries to prevent this from happening by using a regex negative
    # lookahead to exclude '[V***R***C**]' from the prompt pattern, but still match
    # a regular hostname.
