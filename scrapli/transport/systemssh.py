        SystemSSHTransport Object

        Inherit from Transport ABC
        SSH2Transport <- Transport (ABC)

        If using this driver, and passing a ssh_config_file (or setting this argument to `True`),
        all settings in the ssh config file will be superseded by any arguments passed here!

        SystemSSHTransport *always* prefers public key auth if given the option! If auth_private_key
        is set in the provided arguments OR if ssh_config_file is passed/True and there is a key for
        ANY match (i.e. `*` has a key in ssh config file!!), we will use that key! If public key
        auth fails and a username and password is set (manually or by ssh config file), password
        auth will be attempted.

        Note that comms_prompt_pattern, comms_return_char and comms_ansi are only passed here to
        handle "in channel" authentication required by SystemSSH -- these are assigned to private
        attributes in this class and ignored after authentication. If you wish to modify these
        values on a "live" scrapli connection, modify them in the Channel object, i.e.
        `conn.channel.comms_prompt_pattern`. Additionally timeout_ops is passed and assigned to
        _timeout_ops to use the same timeout_ops that is used in Channel to decorate the
        authentication methods here.

        Args:
            host: host ip/name to connect to
            port: port to connect to
            auth_username: username for authentication
            auth_private_key: path to private key for authentication
            auth_password: password for authentication
            auth_strict_key: True/False to enforce strict key checking (default is True)
            auth_bypass: bypass ssh key or password auth for devices without authentication, or that
                have auth prompts after ssh session establishment
            timeout_socket: timeout for ssh session to start -- this directly maps to ConnectTimeout
                ssh argument; see `man ssh_config`
            timeout_transport: timeout for transport in seconds. since system ssh is using popen/pty
                we can't really set a timeout directly, so this value governs the time timeout
                decorator for the transport read and write methods
            timeout_ops: timeout for telnet channel operations in seconds -- this is also the
                timeout for finding and responding to username and password prompts at initial
                login. This is assigned to a private attribute and is ignored after authentication
                is completed.
            timeout_exit: True/False close transport if timeout encountered. If False and keepalives
                are in use, keepalives will prevent program from exiting so you should be sure to
                catch Timeout exceptions and handle them appropriately
            keepalive: whether or not to try to keep session alive
            keepalive_interval: interval to use for session keepalives
            keepalive_type: network|standard -- 'network' sends actual characters over the
                transport channel. This is useful for network-y type devices that may not support
                'standard' keepalive mechanisms. 'standard' is not currently implemented for
                system ssh
            keepalive_pattern: pattern to send to keep network channel alive. Default is
                u'\005' which is equivalent to 'ctrl+e'. This pattern moves cursor to end of the
                line which should be an innocuous pattern. This will only be entered *if* a lock
                can be acquired. This is only applicable if using keepalives and if the keepalive
                type is 'network'
            comms_prompt_pattern: prompt pattern expected for device, same as the one provided to
                channel -- system ssh needs to know this to know how to decide if we are properly
                sending/receiving data -- i.e. we are not stuck at some password prompt or some
                other failure scenario. If using driver, this should be passed from driver (Scrape,
                or IOSXE, etc.) to this Transport class. This is assigned to a private attribute and
                is ignored after authentication is completed.
            comms_return_char: return character to use on the channel, same as the one provided to
                channel -- system ssh needs to know this to know what to send so that we can probe
                the channel to make sure we are authenticated and sending/receiving data. If using
                driver, this should be passed from driver (Scrape, or IOSXE, etc.) to this Transport
                class. This is assigned to a private attribute and is ignored after authentication
                is completed.
            comms_ansi: True/False strip comms_ansi characters from output; this value is assigned
                self._comms_ansi and is ignored after authentication. We only need it for transport
                on the off chance (maybe never?) that username/password prompts contain ansi
                characters, otherwise "comms_ansi" is really a channel attribute and is treated as
                such. This is assigned to a private attribute and is ignored after authentication
                is completed.
