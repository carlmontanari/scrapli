                telnet uses telnetlib
                choice of driver depends on the features you need. in general system is easiest as
                it will just 'auto-magically' use your ssh config file ('~/.ssh/config' or
                '/etc/ssh/config_file'). ssh2 is very very fast as it is a thin wrapper around
                libssh2 however it is slightly feature limited. paramiko is slower than ssh2, but
                has more features built in (though scrapli does not expose/support them all).
                explicitly added here to allow for nicely checking if transport is telnet.
