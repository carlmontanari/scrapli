            comms_prompt_pattern: raw string regex pattern -- preferably use `^` and `$` anchors!
                this is the single most important attribute here! if this does not match a prompt,
                scrapli will not work!
                IMPORTANT: regex search uses multi-line + case insensitive flags. multi-line allows
                for highly reliably matching for prompts however we do NOT strip trailing whitespace
                for each line, so be sure to add '\\s*' if your device needs that. This should be
                mostly sorted for you if using network drivers (i.e. `IOSXEDriver`). Lastly, the
                case insensitive is just a convenience factor so i can be lazy.

                cases for this callable would be to disable paging or accept any kind of banner

                Common use cases for this callable would be to save configurations prior to exiting,
