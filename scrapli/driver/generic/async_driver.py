        Interact with a device with changing prompts per input.

        Used to interact with devices where prompts change per input, and where inputs may be hidden
        such as in the case of a password input. This can be used to respond to challenges from
        devices such as the confirmation for the command "clear logging" on IOSXE devices for
        example. You may have as many elements in the "interact_events" list as needed, and each
        element of that list should be a tuple of two or three elements. The first element is always
        the input to send as a string, the second should be the expected response as a string, and
        the optional third a bool for whether or not the input is "hidden" (i.e. password input)

        An example where we need this sort of capability:

        ```
        3560CX#copy flash: scp:
        Source filename []? test1.txt
        Address or name of remote host []? 172.31.254.100
        Destination username [carl]?
        Writing test1.txt
        Password:

        Password:
         Sink: C0644 639 test1.txt
        !
        639 bytes copied in 12.066 secs (53 bytes/sec)
        3560CX#
        ```

        To accomplish this we can use the following:

        ```
        interact = conn.channel.send_inputs_interact(
            [
                ("copy flash: scp:", "Source filename []?", False),

                ("super_secure_password", prompt, True),
            ]
        )
        ```

        interact "events".

            interact_events: list of tuples containing the "interactions" with the device
                each list element must have an input and an expected response, and may have an
                optional bool for the third and final element -- the optional bool specifies if the
                input that is sent to the device is "hidden" (ex: password), if the hidden param is
                not provided it is assumed the input is "normal" (not hidden)

            privilege_level: ignored in this base class; for LSP reasons for subclasses
            timeout_ops: timeout ops value for this operation; only sets the timeout_ops value for
                the duration of the operation, value is reset to initial value after operation is

        Read from a channel and react to the output with some callback.

        This method is kind of like an "advanced" send_interactive -- the idea is simple: send some
        "stuff" to the channel (optionally), and then read from the channel. Based on the output
        do something. The callbacks is a list of `ReadCallback` which is an object containing the
        actual callback to execute, some info about when to trigger that callback (also when *not*
        to trigger that callback), as well as some attributes to control the next (if desired)
        iteration of read_callback. You could in theory do basically everything with this method by
        chaining callbacks forever, but you probably don't want to do that for real!

        Example usage:

        ```
        from scrapli.driver.core import IOSXEDriver
        from scrapli.driver.generic.base_driver import ReadCallback
        from scrapli.driver.generic.sync_driver import GenericDriver

            print(f"previous read output : {read_output}")

            r = cls.send_command("show run | i hostname")
            print(f"result: {r.result}")


        with IOSXEDriver(**device) as conn:
            callbacks = [
                ReadCallback(

                    complete=True,
                )
            ]
            conn.read_callback(callbacks=callbacks, initial_input="show run | i hostname")
        ```

        Args:
            callbacks: a list of ReadCallback objects
            initial_input: optional string to send to "kick off" the read_callback method
            read_output: optional bytes to append any new reads to
            read_delay: sleep interval between reads
            read_timeout: value to set the `transport_timeout` to for the duration of the reading
                portion of this method. If left default (-1.0) or set to anything below 0, the
                transport timeout value will be left alone (whatever the timeout_transport value is)
                otherwise, the provided value will be temporarily set as the timeout_transport for
                duration of the reading.

        Returns:
            ReadCallbackReturnable: either None or call to read_callback again

        Raises:
            ScrapliTimeout: if the read operation times out (base don the read_timeout value) during
                the read callback check.
