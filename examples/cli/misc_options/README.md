# Misc Options

A grab bag example showing a few "other" options when interacting with a device. This example shows
how you can include or not include inputs and trailing prompts in the captured results. This example
also covers how scrapli handles/respects your inputs via the `input_handling` parameter. Lastly,
there is a very simple example of using the operation timeout setting.
