CHANGELOG
=======

# TBD VERSION
- Add support for `parse_genie` to Response object; obviously really only for Cisco devices at this point unless
 there are parsers floating around out there for other platforms I don't know about!
- Add an `atexit` function for the ssh2 transport which forcibly closes the connection. This fixes a bug where if a
 user did not manually close the connection (or use a context manager for the connection) the script would hang open
  until an interrupt.
- Added a `GenericDriver` for those with non-core platforms. The `GenericDriver` has a really broad prompt pattern
 match, doesn't know about privilege levels or any other device specific stuff, but does provide the `send_command
 `, `send_commands`, `send_interact`, and `get_prompt` methods just like the "core" drivers do. This should be a
  decent starting point for anyone working on non-core platforms!
- Minor unit test improvement to cover send_commands (plural) and to cover the new `GenericDriver`
