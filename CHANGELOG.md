CHANGELOG
=======

# TBD VERSION
- Add support for `parse_genie` to Response object; obviously really only for Cisco devices at this point unless
 there are parsers floating around out there for other platforms I don't know about!
- Add an `atexit` function for the ssh2 transport which forcibly closes the connection. This fixes a bug where if a
 user did not manually close the connection (or use a context manager for the connection) the script would hang open
  until an interrupt.
