## Classes

### Driver


```text
BaseDriver Object

BaseDriver is the root for all Scrapli driver classes. The synchronous and asyncio driver
base driver classes can be used to provide a semi-pexpect like experience over top of
whatever transport a user prefers. Generally, however, the base driver classes should not be
used directly. It is best to use the GenericDriver (or AsyncGenericDriver) or NetworkDriver
(or AsyncNetworkDriver) sub-classes of the base drivers.

Args:
    host: host ip/name to connect to
    port: port to connect to
    auth_username: username for authentication
    auth_private_key: path to private key for authentication
    auth_private_key_passphrase: passphrase for decrypting ssh key if necessary
    auth_password: password for authentication
    auth_strict_key: strict host checking or not
    auth_bypass: bypass "in channel" authentication -- only supported with telnet,
        asynctelnet, and system transport plugins
    timeout_socket: timeout for establishing socket/initial connection in seconds
    timeout_transport: timeout for ssh|telnet transport in seconds
    timeout_ops: timeout for ssh channel operations
    comms_prompt_pattern: raw string regex pattern -- preferably use `^` and `$` anchors!
        this is the single most important attribute here! if this does not match a prompt,
        scrapli will not work!
        IMPORTANT: regex search uses multi-line + case insensitive flags. multi-line allows
        for highly reliably matching for prompts however we do NOT strip trailing whitespace
        for each line, so be sure to add '\\s?' or similar if your device needs that. This
        should be mostly sorted for you if using network drivers (i.e. `IOSXEDriver`).
        Lastly, the case insensitive is just a convenience factor so i can be lazy.
    comms_return_char: character to use to send returns to host
    comms_ansi: True/False strip comms_ansi characters from output, generally the default
        value of False should be fine
    ssh_config_file: string to path for ssh config file, True to use default ssh config file
        or False to ignore default ssh config file
    ssh_known_hosts_file: string to path for ssh known hosts file, True to use default known
        file locations. Only applicable/needed if `auth_strict_key` is set to True
    on_init: callable that accepts the class instance as its only argument. this callable,
        if provided, is executed as the last step of object instantiation -- its purpose is
        primarily to provide a mechanism for scrapli community platforms to have an easy way
        to modify initialization arguments/object attributes without needing to create a
        class that extends the driver, instead allowing the community platforms to simply
        build from the GenericDriver or NetworkDriver classes, and pass this callable to do
        things such as appending to a username (looking at you RouterOS!!). Note that this
        is *always* a synchronous function (even for asyncio drivers)!
    on_open: callable that accepts the class instance as its only argument. this callable,
        if provided, is executed immediately after authentication is completed. Common use
        cases for this callable would be to disable paging or accept any kind of banner
        message that prompts a user upon connection
    on_close: callable that accepts the class instance as its only argument. this callable,
        if provided, is executed immediately prior to closing the underlying transport.
        Common use cases for this callable would be to save configurations prior to exiting,
        or to logout properly to free up vtys or similar
    transport: name of the transport plugin to use for the actual telnet/ssh/netconf
        connection. Available "core" transports are:
            - system
            - telnet
            - asynctelnet
            - ssh2
            - paramiko
            - asyncssh
        Please see relevant transport plugin section for details. Additionally third party
        transport plugins may be available.
    transport_options: dictionary of options to pass to selected transport class; see
        docs for given transport class for details of what to pass here
    channel_lock: True/False to lock the channel (threading.Lock/asyncio.Lock) during
        any channel operations, defaults to False
    channel_log: True/False or a string path to a file of where to write out channel logs --
        these are not "logs" in the normal logging module sense, but only the output that is
        read from the channel. In other words, the output of the channel log should look
        similar to what you would see as a human connecting to a device
    logging_uid: unique identifier (string) to associate to log messages; useful if you have
        multiple connections to the same device (i.e. one console, one ssh, or one to each
        supervisor module, etc.)

Returns:
    None

Raises:
    N/A
