# scrapli

scrapli -- scrap(e c)li --  is a python library focused on connecting to devices, specifically network devices
 (routers/switches/firewalls/etc.) via SSH or Telnet. The name scrapli -- is just "scrape cli" (as in screen scrape)
 squished together! scrapli's goal is to be as fast and flexible as possible, while providing a thoroughly tested, well
  typed, well documented, simple API that supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage.

Feel free to join the very awesome networktocode slack workspace [here](https://networktocode.slack.com/), where you
 will find a `scrapli` channel where you can discuss anything about scrapli, as well as tons of other channels covering
  all sorts of network/network-automation topics!
