# scrapli Netconf


[scrapli_netconf](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_netconf) ([docs](https://scrapli.github.io/scrapli_netconf/)) 
is a netconf driver built on top of scrapli. The purpose of scrapli_netconf is to provide a fast, flexible, 
thoroughly tested, well typed, well documented, simple API that supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage. 
Working together scrapli and scrapli_netconf aim to provide a consistent (as is practical) look and feel when 
automating devices over telnet, SSH, or netconf (over SSH).
