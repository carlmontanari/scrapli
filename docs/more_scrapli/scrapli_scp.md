# Scrapli SCP


[scrapli_scp](https://github.com/viktorkertesz/scrapli_scp) is all about adding smart SCP capability to scrapli -- 
specifically with asyncssh. If you need to SCP things and are using scrapli, you should check this awesome addition 
to the scrapli community. Big thanks to [Viktor](https://github.com/viktorkertesz) for building this and sharing it 
with the community!
