# Scrapli Replay


[scrapli_replay](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_replay) ([docs](https://scrapli.github.io/scrapli_replay/)) 
is a set of tools used to help test scrapli programs. scrapli_replay includes a utility to capture command 
input/output from real life servers and replay them in a semi-interactive fashion, as well as a pytest plugin that 
patches and records and replays session data (like [vcr.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy)) for scrapli connections.
