Contributing
=======

Thanks for thinking about contributing to scrapli! Contributions are not expected, but are quite welcome.

Contributions of all kinds are welcomed -- typos, doc updates, adding examples, bug fixes, and feature adds.


Some notes on contributing:

- Please open an issue to discuss any bug fixes, feature adds, or really any thing that could result in a pull
 request. This allows us to all be on the same page, and could save everyone some extra work!
- Once we've discussed any changes, pull requests are of course welcome and very much appreciated!
  - All PRs should pass tests -- checkout the Makefile for some shortcuts for linting and testing.
  - Please include tests! Even simple/basic tests are better than nothing -- it helps make sure changes in the future
   don't break functionality or make things act in unexpected ways!
- If doing any significant work on scrapli -- particularly on channel, transport, or drivers, take some time to get
 familiar with, vrnetlab. All functional tests -- in order to allow everyone to test functional things in a
  consistent fashion -- rely on vrnetlab!
